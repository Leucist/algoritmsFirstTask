# Project Description

This repository contains a solution to the "Sum of Intervals" problem, which is a part of the "Algorithms and Data Structures" coursework.

## Problem Statement

**Variation E - "Sum of Intervals"**

**Problem Statement:** Given a sequence of `n` closed intervals `<a_i, b_i>`, where `a_i` and `b_i` are integers, and `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 1 000`, `1 <= n <= 1 000 000`, find the sum of intervals from the sequence using the minimum possible number of intervals.

## Input and Output

- **Input:** The input is provided in a text file named `input.txt`. The first line contains the length `n` of the sequence. Subsequent `n` lines contain the intervals in the form of pairs of integers separated by a single space. The first number in each pair represents the beginning of the interval, and the second number represents the end of the interval.

- **Output:** The output is written to a text file named `output.txt`. At least two sets of solutions to the problem are provided in the output. Each set consists of:
  - A line containing the length `l` of the resulting sequence (formed by summing intervals).
  - Subsequent lines in the set contain pairs of numbers separated by spaces, representing the start and end of the resulting intervals.

## Time Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm `T(n)` describes the number of elementary operations it performs depending on the amount of input data, where `n` is the number of intervals in the `input.txt` file.

The time complexity consists of operations related to reading input data from the file at the beginning of the program, denoted as `T0(n)`, the complexity of the first method `T1(n)`, the complexity of the second method `T2(n)`, and the operations involved in writing the answer to a file `T3(n)`.

1. **Reading Data (T0(n)):** The complexity of reading data from the file is `T0(n) = n + 1`, as the procedure is represented as a loop that reads `n` intervals from the file and the number `l` (the number of intervals) at the first line.

2. **Method 1 (T1(n)):** The complexity of method 1 consists of merge sorting and adding the intervals. `T1(n) = nlogn + (n - 1) = θ(n log n)`, as merge sort has a complexity of nlogn, and after sorting, the algorithm performs n-1 comparisons in a loop.

3. **Method 2 (T2(n)):** The complexity of method 2 consists of filling the number line array and converting the obtained number line into an array of intervals. `T2(n) = (n + 1) * 1000 = θ(n)` – in the worst case, as filling the number line can take a maximum of `1000 * n` elementary operations when each of the `n` intervals must be `[0; 1000]`, and the conversion of the number line into an array of intervals is done in a loop with `n` iterations.

4. **Writing Data (T3(n)):** The complexity of writing output data to the file involves two loops, taking `the number of obtained intervals` – a real number `c` (`c` < `n`). `T3(n) = 2 * c`.

Therefore, the total time complexity of the algorithm is: 

> `T(n) = nlogn + 2n + 1 + 2 * c = θ(n log n)`.
